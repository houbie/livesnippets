Cascade constraints are used to cascade validation from one object to a nested (aggregated) object. This makes it possible
to validate a complete object tree with one @validate()@ call.

Cascade constraints can be defined for fields that are themselves @Validateable@ and for maps and collections of
@Validateable@ fields:

{groovySrc:class=Order|from=static|lines=7|inline=true}
{groovySrc}
