A flow can embed an another flow as part of itself. On the other hand a flow can be split up into smaller (reusable) flows.
This is comparable with methods that call other methods or are refactored into smaller methods.

In webflow, this behavior is achieved with subflow states. When a flow is started as a subflow, it will have its own flow scope
separate from the calling flow (cf. local variables in methods).
