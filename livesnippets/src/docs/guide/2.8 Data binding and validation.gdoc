webflow has the same possibilities as controller actions for data binding:

* domain class data binding
{groovySrc:class=ProjectController|from=flow.projectInstance.properties|lines=1|inline=true}
{groovySrc}

* explicit call to @bindData@
{code}
bindData(flow.projectInstance, params)
{code}

* command objects that are automatically instantiated and populated
{code}
on("next") {Project project ->
    assert project.name ==  params.name
}.to("lead")
{code}

After the data binding we can do the validation. If validation fails, we can stay in the same view state by triggering the
build-in @error@ event. The same view will be rendered again for the user, with the invalid fields marked as errors.
{groovySrc:class=ProjectController|from=on("next")|inline=true}
{groovySrc}

{note}
When using the ValidationGrailsPlugin (validation for non-domain classes) in combination with webflow, errors are not always
shown in the view. This happens when the object containing the errors is serialized and de-serialized by webflow.
The [extended validation plugin|guide:3. Grails extended validation plugin] solves this problem.
