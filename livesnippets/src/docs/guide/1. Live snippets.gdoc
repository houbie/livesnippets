The goal of Live Snippets is to bring code snippets and documentation together in a live demo.

Live Snippets targets all Groovy and Grails related stuff.

The source code is available on "github":https://github.com/houbie/livesnippets

The application is currently deployed on "Cloud Foundry":http://livesnippets.cloudfoundry.com

Enjoy!
