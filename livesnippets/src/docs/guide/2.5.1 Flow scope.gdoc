Each flow execution has its own associated flow scope.
If flows are compared with methods, than objects in flow scope are similar to method local variables; they are only
visible within one flow execution and cannot be accessed from calling flows nor subflows.

{note}
Objects in flow scope are automatically merged into the view model when rendering a view. So you should omit the @flow@
prefix when referencing these objects in a view.
