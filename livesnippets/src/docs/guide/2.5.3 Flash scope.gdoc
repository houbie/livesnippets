Webflow defines its own flash scope. Although it has the same semantics as the standard grails flash scope (the main purpose
is to store objects only until after the next request), it is a different scope. This means that objects stored in webflow's
flash scope are not visible in standard grails actions.

{note}
Objects in flash scope are automatically moved to request scope upon transition between states. So you should omit the @flash@
prefix when referencing these objects in a view in this case.
