Most of the views of the project demo app were initially generated with @grails generate-views@.

You typically need to do following with the generated views:
# set the @action@ attribute in forms and links to the flow action
# explicitly fill in the @controller@ attribute in forms and links when using subflows
# add an @event@ attribute to links
# remove the @flash@ prefix in @flash.message@
# use @submitButton@ in stead of @actionSubmit@
