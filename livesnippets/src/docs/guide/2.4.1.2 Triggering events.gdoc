After the view is rendered, the user has to trigger an event to make the flow transition to the next state.

User events can be triggered by clicking on a link:
{gspSrc:view=team|from=<td><g:link|lines=1|inline=true}
{gspSrc}

or by submitting a form:
{gspSrc:view=team|from=<g:form|to=</g:form|inline=true}
{gspSrc}

Note the use of @g:submitButton@ in stead of @g:actionSubmit@. The event that is triggered corresponds to the name attribute.
