Webflow can be combined nicely with ajax, but there is not a lot of documentation on about how to do it.

First of all, you define the ajax event as a transition from a view state to itself:
{groovySrc:class=ProjectController|from=on("removeAjax")|inline=true}
{groovySrc}

Notice the @render@ call to render the template containing the ajax response.

The @Ajax@ suffix in the event names is just a self-documenting convention.

You'll notice that triggering the ajax event with a simple @remoteLink@ will render a complete html page in stead of only the template.
This is solved by adding @ajaxSource=true@ as query parameter to the link.

Another problem is that the flow execution id is not present in the ajax response. This means that if the ajax response
template contains a link, this link won't have a @execution@ query parameter and hence will force the creation of a new
flow execution. This is again solved by adding the query parameter manualy.

The resulting ajax link becomes:
{gspSrc:view=_editStories|from=<td><g:remoteLink|lines=1|inline=true}
{gspSrc}

@formRemote@s suffer from the same problems. Additionally @submitButton@s in a @formRemote@ don't get the correct event
being post. This can again be solved by adding the correct query parameter:
{gspSrc:view=_editStories|from=<g:formRemote|lines=1|inline=true}
{gspSrc}

If the @formRemote@ contains multiple @submitButton@s that need to post different events, the @_eventId@ can be put in a
hidden field and its value set with javascript.
