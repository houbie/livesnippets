Add the @WiredBean@ or @RichDomain@ annotation to your class and use the standard @Inject@ and @Resource@ annotations to mark members that should be auto wired:

{groovySrc:class=CreditCard|from=@|lines=4}
{groovySrc}

Classes that implement Serializable will be wired again after deserialization. Injected fields should be marked as transient in this case.

{note}
The @RichDomain@ annotation combines both the @Validateable@ and @WiredBean@ annotations
