The extended validation plugin is similar to the build-in @ValidationGrailsPlugin@. It makes declarative constraints possible
for classes that are not grails domain classes.

The extra features of the extended validation plugin are:
* constraint groups
* cascaded validation
* instance validators
* partial validation
* errors that survive serialization/de-serialization
