If you want to add bread crumbs to your wizard pages, just call the @breadcrumb@ tag:
{gspSrc:view=projectInfo|from=<flow:|lines=1}
{gspSrc}

This will render bread crumbs for every view state and subflow state. You will get a bread crumbs line for each active subflow.

The bread crumb labels are resolved with the state id as key from the i18n messages and default to the state id.
