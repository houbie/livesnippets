After validating an object tree, the validation errors are attached to the individual objects in the tree. Using the
@renderErrors@ tag to show the errors of the root object of the tree, will only show field errors for that object.
Fields with a cascade constraint will have a @cascade.invalid@ error (if the nested object failed to validate).

In our GSP's we usually want to show all nested errors. That is why @Validateable@ classes have a @getAllErrorsRecursive@
dynamic method that can be used in a view:
{gspSrc:view=invoiceData|from=14|lines=7}
{gspSrc}
