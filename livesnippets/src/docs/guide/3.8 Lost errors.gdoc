With the @ValidationGrailsPlugin@ in combination with flow scoped objects, it is possible that validation errors are not
rendered after serialization/de-serialization of the objects. This is solved in the extended validation plugin by an ASTTransformation
that is linked to the @Validateable@ annotation. The ASTTransformation adds a serializable error id to the objects for
error retrieval.
