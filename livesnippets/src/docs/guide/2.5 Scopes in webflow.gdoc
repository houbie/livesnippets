Webflow defines, besides page request and session scope, three special scopes:
# flow scope
# conversation scope
# flash scope

In stead of keeping everything in the HTTP session, Webflow uses serialization to store flow states for scalability reasons.
That is why Objects that are stored in flash, flow or conversation scope must implement @java.io.Serializable@, otherwise webflow will throw an exception.
