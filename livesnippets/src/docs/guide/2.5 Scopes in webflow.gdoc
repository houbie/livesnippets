Webflow defines, besides page request and session scope, three special scopes:
# flow scope
# conversation scope
# flash scope

For scalability reasons, Webflow uses serialization to store flow states in stead of keeping everything in the HTTP session.
That is why objects that are stored in flow or conversation scope must implement @java.io.Serializable@, otherwise webflow will throw an exception.
