The constraints of @Validateable@ classes can easily be unit tested.
You only have to attach the dynamic validation methods to the class under test:
{groovySrc:class=OrderTests|from=protected}
{groovySrc}

From then on you can test the constraints as usual:
{groovySrc:class=OrderTests|from=void|lines=6}
{groovySrc}
