In grails 1.3.5, 1.3.6 and 1.3.7, url's in subflow pages needed to specify the subflow controller and action.

If the last state in a flow is a subflow state, then navigating back after such a flow completes, will navigate to the
controller and action of the subflow. This typically generates an exception if the preconditions for the subflow are not met.

This problem is solved in 2.0.0 by not specifying the controller and action in forms and links.
