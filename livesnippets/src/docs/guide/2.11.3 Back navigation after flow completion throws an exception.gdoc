Prior to grails 1.3.5, subflow states needed to have the same name as the subflow they called, making flow not generally
reusable. As a side effect of the fix for this problem, the url that the user sees changes when a subflow is called.

If the last state in a flow is a subflow state, then navigating back after such a flow completes, will navigate to the
controller and action of the subflow. This typically generates an exception if the preconditions for the subflow are not met.
