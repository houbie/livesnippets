The start state is simply the first state in the flow definition (the @projectInfo@ state in the newProjectWizard flow)

End states are states that don't have a body (a method call without arguments)
{groovySrc:class=DeveloperController|from=cancel|lines=1}
{groovySrc}

or states that only contain a @redirect@ call or [flow output|guide:2.4.4.3 Subflow output]:
{groovySrc:class=ProjectController|from=end \{}
{groovySrc}

{note}
Prior to 2.0.0, @redirect@ calls that take a uri or url parameter are not supported in end states
